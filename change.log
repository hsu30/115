# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- N/A

### Changed
- **(Optimization)** Refactored the settings UI (`ui.js`) to cache DOM elements, significantly reducing redundant queries and improving responsiveness.
- **(Optimization)** Optimized the configuration save logic (`store.js`) to use a single `chrome.storage.set` operation instead of multiple, improving performance.
- **(Refactor)** Modified the settings UI (`ui.js`) to dynamically display the extension's version from the manifest (`chrome.runtime.getManifest().version`) rather than a hardcoded value.

### Deprecated
- N/A

### Removed
- **(Refactor)** Removed dead code from the service worker (`background.js`) that improperly used `localStorage`.

### Fixed
- **(MV3 Fix)** Updated `manifest.json` to include `<all_urls>` in `host_permissions`, fixing the inability to connect to user-defined Aria2 RPC servers under Manifest V3 rules.
- **(Bug Fix)** Corrected a bug in `store.js` that caused synced configuration data from `chrome.storage.sync` to be saved incorrectly to local storage.

### Security
- N/A
